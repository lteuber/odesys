> Odesys, a pure act of socio-technical design integration to confront conflicts and dissolve problems with and for people.

*Why, so often,*

*.... do we build what nobody wants?*

*.... do engineers optimise their solutions based only on physical capabilities and fail to consider the stakeholders’ desires?*

*.... do policy makers keep the decision-making process non-transparent and nonparticipatory?*

*.... do conflicts stem from failed attempts to constructively design?*

*.... do we continue to democratically govern through past compromises instead of socially designing future syntheses?*


These are typical questions arising from real-life experiences within the public space, our built environment and infrastructure management practices. The actual answer to these questions is that socio-technical problems are often solved from a one-sided point of view, without considering the fact that the problem is multifaceted. Misrepresenting this complex and interconnected problem nature results in what we call ‘bridges to nowhere’ solutions. Therefore, a participatory process that does justice to both the ’hard’ technical and ’soft’ social aspects within solving these problems is needed. It is thus crucial to truly connect and bridge the gap between human preferences (‘desirability’) and system performances (‘capability’) using transparent models for complex systems design and integration solutions (‘feasibility’). These models offer unprecedented opportunities and ‘bridges to anywhere’ solutions. Moreover, if stakeholders dare to confront their conflicts and put their ‘cards’ openly on the table, pure best fit for common purpose design solutions will become possible. Designing is thus a matter of conflict dissolution.

The state of the art design methodology Open Design Systems (‘Odesys’), as introduced in this book, enables all the aforementioned and answers the above questions. It is Odesys’ purpose to foster adoption of civil infrastructures that surround us every day through a multi-system level socio-technical approach, supported by sound mathematical open-glass box models as means of observation during participatory design and collaborative decision-making. Here, systems thinking and a stakeholder-oriented focus is required to search for different solutions within an open-ended solution space, uniting both capability (technics) derived from the system properties, and desirability (economics) derived from individual subject’s objectives. This will result in an open dialogue and co-design approach that enables a-priori best-fit for common purpose design synthesis dissolution, rather than a-posteriori normative design compromise absolution. This makes Odesys a pure socio-technical systems integration methodology that offers a wide range of multiobjective design and decision making applications, uniting stakeholder preferences (‘what a human wants’) and physical assets performances (‘what a system can deliver’). Moreover, classical multi-objective design optimisation methods suffer from fundamental mathematical flaws and do not provide a single best-fit design configuration, but rather a set of design alternatives. This leaves designers without a unique solution to their problems.
