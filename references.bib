	abstract = {Construction project management requires dynamic mitigation control ensuring the project's timely completion by a best fit for common purpose strategy for all stakeholders. Current mitigation approaches are usually performed by an iterative Monte Carlo (MC) analysis focussing on lowest-cost strategies which do not include (1) the project manager's goal-oriented behaviour, (2) automated network restructuring potential, and (3) multi-dimensional optimization criteria for best fitting mitigation strategies-criteria. Therefore, the development statement within this paper is to design a method and implementation tool that properly dissolves all the aforementioned shortcomings ensuring the project's completion date by finding the most effective and efficient mitigation strategy. To fulfill the purpose of this paper, the Mitigation Controller (MitC) has been developed using an integrative approach of non-linear optimization techniques, probabilistic Monte Carlo simulation, and preference function modeling. Compared to the conventional way of mitigating project delays. The developed MitC allows mitigating potential delays with the least negative consequences on several project criteria, such as cost, environmental impact, etc. The application of the model to the demonstrative case study shows the ability of the model to significantly increase the probability of completing the project in the given target duration. Embedding the multi-criteria evaluation in the optimization model ensures that other interests are also represented in finding the optimal strategy for project delays.},

	abstract = {Current methods for optimising systems design are one-sided when they do not consider the socio-technical interaction between stakeholder preferences ('what a human wants') and the capability of technical assets ('what a system can deliver'). Moreover, classical multi-objective optimisation methods suffer from fundamental mathematical flaws. Also, the often used classical Pareto front does not provide a single best-fit design configuration, but rather a set of design alternatives. This leaves designers without a unique solution to their problems. Finally, current multi-objective optimisation processes are not well aligned with design practice, because they do not sufficiently involve decision makers and do not translate their interests into a single common preference domain to find an overall group optimum. This paper introduces a new Open Design Systems (Odesys) methodology and a new Integrative Maximisation of Aggregated Preferences (IMAP) method, implemented in the Preferendus tool. The added value and the use of these are exemplified in two infrastructure design applications, showing how pure best fit-for-common-purpose design results can be achieved.},

Currently, there is very little transparency vis-à-vis the logistics challenges in the industry. We extend the literature by creating an overall view of the coherency between logistical methods and project performance. We develop knowledge about how to use the various approaches by analyzing different logistical solutions. A holistic view of the coherency between the approaches in terms of logistics and project performance, taking into consideration the external influence of weather, is provided through analysis of actual projects in the North Sea region. Case study findings reveal the major factors to be pre-assembly, vessel load, and the distance to shore. We suggest a pre-assembly strategy comprised of a minimum number of components for installation onsite and a maximum number of turbines to be loaded on a vessel. These findings are especially important for the new wind farms being positioned further offshore. We show by means of a case study, with specific characteristics and weather conditions, that the appropriate strategies can be arrived at by using a simulation-based decision-support tool we developed.},

So far the first German offshore wind farm was constructed and put into operation by "Alpha Ventus". Experiences illustrate that bad weather conditions are the main cause for delays in transport, handling and installation of offshore wind farms. This can lead to extensive project delays up to several months. The main objective of current logistical research activities is the robust design of planning and control methods for offshore installations. In this study, the basic conditions and existing disturbances of supply chains for offshore installations are analyzed. Based on these results, a planning and control concept will be introduced. Additionally, a mathematical model using mixed integer linear programming (MILP) is developed. It calculates the optimal installation schedule for offshore wind farms by observing different weather conditions. The model can be used to reduce vessel operation times in dependence on seasonal or up-to-date weather forecasts.},

@mastersthesis{tjaberings_cost-effectivity_2022,
	address = {Delft},
	title = {Cost-effectivity of logistical strategies for the installation of offshore wind turbine substructures},
	abstract = {The ever-increasing size of offshore wind turbine substructures and the development of wind farms at sites further offshore, with greater water depths and with extremer weather conditions, raise logistical challenges that have never been faced before. Additionally, the offshore wind industry has to deal with governments cutting subsidies, small profit margins and limited practice guidelines, while it is expected to lower the associated levelised cost of energy to a competitive level in the market. Scientific studies have identified room for optimisation in the substructure (the focus is laid on Monopiles (MPs) with Transition Pieces (TPs) and pre-piled jackets) transportation and installation phases. However, no studies that evaluate the performance of strategies for these phases are identified. Hence, the objective of this study is to “generate insights into the complex system of interdependent strategies for the installation of offshore wind turbine substructures, and to identify and quantify cost-reduction opportunities.” The considered strategies are formed by combinations of transportation and installation strategies, which differentiate based on the number and type of the deployed vessels and the sequence in which the operations are performed.
To quantitatively compare the strategies, and to consider stochastic processes (e.g., weather conditions), a discrete-event simulation modelling approach is adopted. To arrive at substantiated conclusions, the framework by Manuj et al. (2009) is followed, which provides a roadmap and rigour criteria for the design, implementation and evaluation phases. First, a conceptual model is developed and face validated. Next, a numerical “base model” is constructed, which describes the most basic strategy. This model is face validated by industry experts and evaluated by parameter variability, convergence and historical data validation tests. It is concluded that the base model is structured according to shared practical experiences, responds satisfactory to parameter changes, requires 35 simulation runs to converge, and has good predictive capabilities. Hence, it is deemed suitable to function as a “template” for the modelling of the other strategies.
The simulation results are evaluated for each of the considered substructures separately. (i) MP – TP installation. In general, assembly-line installation strategies, in which two Heavy Lift Vessels (HLVs) are deployed, are associated with the shortest installation time. The shuttling –
assembly-line and the shuttling–alternating (in which MPs and TPs are installed alternatingly) strategies are associated with the lowest costs. Both involve a shuttling transportation strategy, in which the HLV(s) ensure(s) both the transportation and installation of the components. The mooring of barges alongside an HLV in feeder strategies (feeder vessels supply components to an HLV, which stays at the wind farm under development) and the installation of TPs by a relatively small HLV in assembly-line strategies are identified as the main bottlenecks. Reducing these by relatively simple solutions can result in significant performance increases. Lastly, the project start date is found to be a strong determinant of strategy performance. (ii) Jacket – foundation pile installation. The assembly-line strategies are found to result in the shortest jacket installation times as well. However, only the shuttling – assembly-line strategy is additionally associated with the lowest costs. Furthermore, it is found that a separate pile-dredging vessel can help to reduce the time and costs associated with separate phases installation strategies, in which jackets and their foundation piles are installed in different phases. Also for jackets, the barge mooring alongside the HLV is identified to be the largest bottleneck. Reducing this bottleneck can result in significant performance benefits. Lastly, a relationship is found between the performance of jacket installation strategies and the project start date, although weaker than for MP installation.
The developed decision support tool can provide a platform for further research into the logistics of offshore wind and other industries, whereas the obtained results are only valid within the set boundaries. To widen the applicability, it is recommended to perform follow-up studies in which a stochastic mechanical failure component is included, and the sensitivity to the wind farm size and port-to-farm distance is tested. Furthermore, it is advised to extend this study to investigate the potential of the industry adopting a more holistic process or market point of view.},

Hence, both the construction management optimization and the reduction of deployment expenditures should be supported by automated decision support models which include proper representations of predominant uncertainties. One of these is the supply disruption risk that is often ignored in existing models. Therefore, this article proposes a methodology to properly take this construction risk into account. An algorithm to model this risk was developed and a study was conducted to obtain the required probability distributions of disruption delays using real data and expert judgments for an offshore wind farm construction application. The simulation of a realistic test case with an appropriately modified stochastic simulation tool showed that it is important to consider this risk in order to make optimal decisions for different offshore wind farm construction strategies.},

	title = {Probabilistic decision support for offshore wind operations: a {Bayesian} {Network} approach to include the dependence of the installation activities},
	abstract = {Offshore wind operations are logistical challenges and require improved management of the installation and maintenance processes. For this reason, numerous models have been developed concerning different aspects of these operations. Most of these models assume constant durations for the installation or maintenance activities or employ probability distributions to describe the associated uncertainty. However, these two approaches do not take into account the dependence between the activities. This paper proposes a method to describe the dependence between the main installation activities of offshore wind turbines (WTGs) by the use of a non-parametric Bayesian Network (NPBN). To achieve this, different tests were performed and the NPBN was quantified based on real data from a realized project. To illustrate the impact of neglecting the dependence between the activities, a hypothetical case regarding the installation of 150 WTGs was simulated for all three aforementioned approaches (non-dependent: deterministic and probabilistic vs. dependent). It was found that the proposed approach allows for a proper representation of the dependence between the installation activities. Moreover, it can lead to more accurate and reliable estimated installation duration. Hence, this NPBN model can effectively support decision makers in optimizing the work planning of offshore wind processes.},

	abstract = {© 2017 ACM. There is an increasing interest in learning outside of the traditional classroom setting. This is especially true for topics covering computational tools and data science, as both are challenging to incorporate in the standard curriculum. These atypical learning environments offer new opportunities for teaching, particularly when it comes to combining conceptual knowledge with hands-on experience/expertise with methods and skills. Advances in cloud computing and containerized environments provide an attractive opportunity to improve the effciency and ease with which students can learn. This manuscript details recent advances towards using commonly-Available cloud computing services and advanced cyberinfrastructure support for improving the learning experience in bootcamp-style events. We cover the benets (and challenges) of using a server hosted remotely instead of relying on student laptops, discuss the technology that was used in order to make this possible, and give suggestions for how others could implement and improve upon this model for pedagogy and reproducibility.},

	abstract = {© 2017 Holdgraf, Rieger, Micheli, Martin, Knight and Theunissen. Cognitive neuroscience has seen rapid growth in the size and complexity of data recorded from the human brain as well as in the computational tools available to analyze this data. This data explosion has resulted in an increased use of multivariate, model-based methods for asking neuroscience questions, allowing scientists to investigate multiple hypotheses with a single dataset, to use complex, time-varying stimuli, and to study the human brain under more naturalistic conditions. These tools come in the form of “Encoding” models, in which stimulus features are used to model brain activity, and “Decoding” models, in which neural features are used to generated a stimulus output. Here we review the current state of encoding and decoding models in cognitive electrophysiology and provide a practical guide toward conducting experiments and analyses in this emerging field. Our examples focus on using linear models in the study of human language and audition. We show how to calculate auditory receptive fields from natural sounds as well as how to decode neural recordings to predict speech. The paper aims to be a useful tutorial to these approaches, and a practical introduction to using machine learning and applied statistics to build models of neural activity. The data analytic approaches we discuss may also be applied to other sensory modalities, motor systems, and cognitive systems, and we cover some examples in these areas. In addition, a collection of Jupyter notebooks is publicly available as a complement to the material covered in this paper, providing code examples and tutorials for predictive modeling in python. The aimis to provide a practical understanding of predictivemodeling of human brain data and to propose best-practices in conducting these analyses.},
