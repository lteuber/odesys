# Preface

As part of this Odesys methodology, a new Integrative Maximised Aggregated Preference (IMAP) 
optimisation method for maximising aggregated preferences is introduced. According to classical 
decision theory, decisions are based on preference. Here, preference is an expression of the 
degree of ’satisfaction’, and it describes the utility or value that something provides. 
That is why we translate all the different stakeholder objectives (including money) into one 
common preference domain to find a best-fitting aggregated optimum. The IMAP method forms the 
basis of a new software decision support tool called the Preferendus, in which individual 
stakeholder preferences, social objective- and technical design performance functions are 
integrated into one aggregated preference function. Here, Odesys combines the state of the 
art mathematical principles of Preference Function Modeling (PFM) with both the extended 
social threefolding theory and the models from the organizational development theory-U. Odesys 
takes the mathematical application of the PFM theory a step further by extending it from an 
a-posteriori evaluation to an a-priori design methodology. Moreover, it uses PFM based 
multi-criteria decision analysis and the social threefolding theory to derive the so-called 
Corporate Social Identity (CSI) indicator, which is an expression to identify the socio-eco 
purpose and corporate responsibility of an organization. Odesys also introduces a new threefold 
modeling framework linked with the openended Odesys U-diagram, that connects the socio-technical design process, 
through a three-layer metamorphosis of picture-purpose and prototype and incorporates three open-ended design loops: 
(1) open config – technical cycle, (2) open space -social cycle and (3) open source - the purpose cycle.
Odesys’ added value and use are demonstrated for design and decision applications within a real-life
engieering management and service provisioning context showing how to achieve pure ’best-fit’ for common purpose solutions. 


First of all, this book can be used by academic colleagues working in the field of complex systems design. 
The methodology is not limited to infrastructure and building applications in public space, but Odesys and its 
IMAP/Preferendus can also be used for a much broader range of participatory design and decision-making problems. 
Problems that need to be solved within a socio-technical context, where multiple stakeholders with different conflicting 
interests are seeking to arrive at the best solutions for common solutions or where stalemate situations need to be 
dissolved through transparent conflict management. Therefore, this book is also of interest to industrial professionals 
working within public and/or private organizations, where socio-technical decision-making can be both hardened and opened 
by the Odesys principles and its Preferendus. Only this will enable organizations or cooperating organizations, where 
old so-called democratic top-down control decision-making processes govern, to transform themselves into sociocratic 
bottom-up organizations where participatory and open-minded design processes result in future-oriented socially 
responsible synthesis solutions.


Secondly, this book serves as the primary reference material for a substantial number of TU Delft systems design and 
management courses for master students (MSc) from diverse backgrounds. All of these integrative engineering and 
management courses are being conducted along the principles of the state of the art educational ODL concept. ODL is a 
constructivist and design-based learning approach (“learn to design by real-life designing”) where students actively 
develop new solutions originating from their inner and outer designs. It forms the fundamental basis for creating ‘open, 
integrative and persistent learners’ concerned about dissolving future world problems. ODL, like Odesys, is not limited 
to education within a technical context. It is in fact an educational concept that in principle can be used in any 
discipline where there is an openness to apply design-based learning to develop what does not yet exist, instead of 
instructivist research-based learning which investigates what already exists.

Thirdly the name of this book, Odesys, is not just an abbreviation, but is inspired by Odysseus, who was a legendary 
Greek king of Ithaca and one of the most influential Greek problem solving champions. To become a true Odesys engineer, 
three typical sayings from the famous Odysseus stories might be companions on your personal problem solving journey:
- ‘Find an Odysseus ruse, like the Trojan horse‘, meaning a creative way out of a seemingly insoluble problem;
- ‘Be able to choose between Scylla and Charybdis‘, meaning how to find/ secure the golden mean even in the case where one has to (merely) balance between ‘two evils’;
- ‘Make use of Cassandra information‘, meaning a prophecy of doom that later proves to be correct and in particular based on true relevant information that one should not or does not want to hear.
